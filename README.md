# GeneExpression

Comapring performance of models Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest and ANN to predict coronary heart disease using gene expression data. Analysing top genes for each model to cross reference them to existing studies.

## Observation

While searching for the connection of top 5 genes with coronary heart disease, it was noted that genes whose expression is related to protein metabolism, cell proliferation and inflammation are connected to coronary heart diseases. It will be interesting to find such genes from different studies and find their correlation to given classes in the data, thus giving more weight to such features can improve our model. </br>

Expression profile of circular RNAs in epicardial adipose tissue in heart failure‚Äù, Mei-Li Zheng a study done in November 2020 was based on  extending the existing studies that circular RNA expression profiles can be detected in various tissue types. This study aimed at identifying the genes corresponding to circular RNAs thus it found the genes that were involved in cell proliferation and inflammatory response i.e. involved in coronary heart diseases. One of these genes is **RHOBTB3**. This study confirms that such specific genes through circular RNAs show connection to heart failure in Humans.
